  For any human being, education is one of the most important needs in life. It not only enables us to understand and live in this world, but also to help the society in moving forward in general, and even helping yourself in particular. And what would education be without having books? Many-a-times, we don't have libraries nearby, and have to purchase books costing thousands of rupees only for it to lie dormant after its usage time. But what if, instead of having to buy the book, you could rent it for a set period of time for a much much lower cost? You own a book that cost you 1500 bucks. But what to do now, as it sits collecting dust. What if you could give it temporarily to someone for something monetary? Enter Libre

# Android App
The app lets you see books that are out for rent by other people. You just need to sign up and voila, that's it. You can view and contact the seller directly with information from the app. With the app you can
 - view books put up for rent by other people
 - comment on books and give a review
 - bookmark a book to read it later
 - add your own books for renting

# Web Portal
The web portal is an alternative for people who are not on Android Devices, it offers the same services on any web browser instead.

# Use Case
We are trying to include the book owners and the interested readers in a friendly ecosystem that can benefit both the parties in play.
